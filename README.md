11/15 NYC DataDive UN MyWorld project

## Requirements
You'll need git to clone this repository.  If you don't have git install, check out [this guide](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## Code
This repo is the home for all project-related code.  Folders for munging, analysis, and visualization code have also been created.  Putting code in its respective folder will help everyone stay organized and productive.  A requrements.txt file has also been included.  If your scripts require packages please add to this file.  (If you're not using python, obviously add any other requirements files as well!)  

## Goals, Tasks, & Documentation
Information about the project can be found on the [project hackpad](https://nycdatadive2013.hackpad.com/UN-Data-Diving-the-Worlds-Development-Priorities-Sx5jyKs0J5o).  There you'll find details about the project Data Ambassadors, volunteers, tasks, and goals.  

## Data
All of the data for dive-related tasks can be found on the [project dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home/MyWorld%20Public).  If you'd like to add data files talk to a Data Ambassador and they will share the folder with you.
